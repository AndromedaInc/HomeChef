# Andromeda's HomeChef
### An app to buy and sell home cooked meals directly from a local chef.

Have you ever wanted your mom's home cooking, but she lived too far away? Or maybe you had the most amazing Pad Thai from a sweet lady in Thailand, and you wonder where you can find such authentic cuisine. 

Perhaps you've been told time and again that your food is good enough to sell. Or you've been struggling to find employment, but you can make a delicious meal. Maybe you enjoy baking every day, but people in your life are complaining that they are gaining weight from all your amazing baked goods. 

### HomeChef is here for you. 

California recently passed a law allowing people to sell homemade food! HomeChef is making that food available to you!
